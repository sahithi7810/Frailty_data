## 2. Correlation

We calculated the Pearson correlation between grip strength (kg) and frailty (binary Y=1, N=0).  

**Correlation coefficient (r): −0.48**

## 3. Interpretation

From the summary, the average grip strength in this small sample was around 26 kg, with some variation across participants. The correlation value of about −0.48 suggests a **moderate negative relationship** between grip strength and frailty. This means that participants with weaker grip strength were more likely to be identified as frail.  

Although this is consistent with what clinical research often reports, the dataset here is very small (n = 10), so the results should only be taken as an example of the workflow, not as strong evidence. Still, it demonstrates that grip strength can be a useful and simple indicator when studying frailty in health data.
