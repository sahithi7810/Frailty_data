## V1 — Gender Boxplots (Math vs Reading)
The boxplots show that female students generally perform better in reading compared to male students. The median reading score for females is higher and the spread of scores is narrower. On the other hand, male students show slightly higher performance in math on average, although the distributions overlap. The variability in math scores appears greater for both genders than in reading. This suggests gender differences in performance are more pronounced in reading than in math. Overall, the figure highlights that reading is a relative strength for females, while math shows less consistent gender differences.

## V2 — Test Preparation Impact on Math
The chart comparing math scores by test preparation status shows a clear difference between students who completed the test preparation course and those who did not. Students with preparation tend to score higher, with both the median and upper quartile elevated compared to the non-preparation group. The non-prep group shows more low outliers, indicating weaker performance without test prep. This supports the idea that structured preparation provides a measurable benefit. While not every student gains equally, the general upward shift in scores is evident.

## V3 — Lunch Type and Average Performance
The grouped bar chart shows that students with a standard lunch consistently achieve higher average scores across math, reading, and writing. In contrast, those with free or reduced lunch perform lower on average. This pattern may reflect broader socioeconomic differences, where access to better resources and nutrition could play a role in academic outcomes. The gap is consistent across all subjects, suggesting a structural factor rather than subject-specific strengths. The results underline the importance of equity in access to basic needs and educational support.

## V4 — Subject Correlations
The heatmap of subject correlations indicates that math, reading, and writing scores are strongly and positively correlated. Reading and writing have the highest correlation, reflecting that literacy skills often reinforce each other. Math is also positively related to both reading and writing, though slightly weaker than the reading–writing pair. These strong relationships imply that students who perform well in one subject are likely to do well in others. This suggests that improving foundational skills in one domain may carry benefits into the others.

## V5 — Math vs Reading with Trend Lines by Test Prep
The scatterplot with regression lines shows a strong positive association between reading and math scores. Students who completed test preparation generally score higher in both subjects, with their regression line shifted upward. Interestingly, while both groups show similar slopes, the intercept is higher for the prep-completed group, meaning they achieve higher math scores at equivalent reading levels. The clustering of points indicates that the relationship is consistent across the population. This supports the conclusion that preparation improves outcomes without fundamentally changing the math–reading link.
